Is YMAP Perfect ?
No

Is it a MLO ?
No

Why ?
Because no

Does it conflict with other maps ? 
It should not unless a map is directly in the same location

Why no interior details ?
Because not everyone here wants the same interior you want, most people use object spawners in game to place what they want or you can edit it in CodeWalker
